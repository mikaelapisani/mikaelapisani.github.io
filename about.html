      <p class="p1">Hello! My name is Mikaela Pisani. I'm the Machine Learning Lead at <a href="https://www.rootstrap.com/">Rootstrap</a> ando also work with the AI Research team at <a href="https://www.ort.edu.uy/">ORT University</a> in Montevideo, Uruguay. I am a Computer Engineer with a Master's in Data Science from Texas Tech University under Fulbright scholarship. <br> <br> I am also a Co-Managing Director at <a href="https://linktr.ee/girlsintechuy">Girls in Tech Uruguay</a>  a non-profit organization focused on the engagement, education, and empowerment of women and girls in tech, as well as educating children on STEAM. I am an active member of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ai-wonder-girls/">AI Wonder Girls</a>, a community of women in Artificial Intelligence (AI) whose mission is to inspire more women in AI and support each other in learning and professional growth.

      <br><br>In addition, I am part of an interdisciplinary group called ANT. <a href="http://ant.net.uy/">ANT</a> aims to create artistic devices by integrating its three core 

      disciplines - Art, Neuroscience, and Technology. 
      With ANT as well as Girls in Tech, we perform workshops about STEAM for children, families and teachers.
      I also belong to <a href="https://fibras.uy/">Fibras</a>, an non-profit organization that seeks to support projects with social impact through the use of technology.   

       <br> <br> For all my contributions in STEM, encouraging children, performing workshops and talks, raising awareness about bias in AI is why I won the prize  <a href="https://womenawards.globant.com/">Globant Awards</a> ¨Women That Build¨ as well as have been selected as a finalist in <a href="https://www.womentech.net/women-tech-awards/finalists/2022?combine=mikaela&webform_submission_value_4=Global+AI+Inclusion+Award">Women In Tech Awards</a> under the category ¨Global AI Inclusion¨.
